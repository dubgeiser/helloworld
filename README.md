# helloworld

Some "Hello World" implementations to get a little feel for a programming
language.

Write out a greeting (the typical "Hello, world") but with a little extra:

- Write "Hello, " and then a name
- If a name was passed on the command line, print that.
- If no name was given => Ask the user for it.
